~~next: find out how sparse VAE encoding is done. Basically, are voxels encoded into volume sparsely? And maybe finish your Teaching Robots to repair work? it's pretty good too~~
~~However, you can *research* on 3d model generation and encoding for your future work. Having that hard data will allow you to think during your coding of Teaching Robots to Repair~~
~~Note: having the information about sparse VAE data reconstruction is actually very helpful. And will help your 3d data encoding!~~
